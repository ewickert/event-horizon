<h2>Event Horizon</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In a dangerous region of space, your spacecraft must dodge quickly forming
black holes. Stay alive as long as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Event horizon is meant to evoke the challenge of old arcade games, and competing
for high scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Black holes spawn around the player, attempting to draw them in. Players use the
arrow keys to maneuver there ships away from the black holes. Black holes have
different intensities and durations.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Prototype should demonstrate working black hole physics and player movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The players spacecraft will behave under fairly realistic physics, using the mass
and distance from black holes to determine the rate of pull. Ship thrust and
momentum will also be based as closely as possible on reality.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Your spaceship has blundered into a dangerous region of space. Try not to die.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
